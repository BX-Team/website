# Setting up Sentry Integration

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## Prerequisites

    1. **Sentry Account:** You need an account on [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/). They offer free tiers suitable for many servers.  
    2. **Sentry Project:** Create a new project within your Sentry organization.  
       - When asked for the platform, choose **Java**. If Java isn't immediately visible, select "Other" or search for it.  
    3. **DSN (Data Source Name):** Once your project is created, navigate to its settings. Under **Client Keys (DSN)** copy the DSN string, which looks like:  
       ```
       https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@o######.ingest.sentry.io/#######
       ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Configuration Steps

    1. **Open DivineMC config file**  
       Open `divinemc.yml` file located in the root of your server directory.

    2. **Find the Sentry Section**  
       Locate the `sentry:` block, which by default looks like:
       ```yaml
       sentry:
         # The DSN for Sentry, a service that provides real-time crash reporting that helps you monitor and fix crashes in real time. Leave blank to disable. Obtain link at https://sentry.io
         dsn: ''
         # Logs with a level higher than or equal to this level will be recorded.
         log-level: WARN
         # Only log Throwable exceptions to Sentry.
         only-log-thrown: true
       ```

    3. **Configure the Settings**  
       - **`dsn`:** Replace the empty quotes with your DSN, e.g.  
         ```yaml
         dsn: 'https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@o######.ingest.sentry.io/#######'
         ```  
       - **`log-level`:** Choose severity threshold (`ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`). Default is `WARN`.  
       - **`only-log-thrown`:**  
         - `true`: Only send logs with a Java `Throwable` (recommended).  
         - `false`: Send any log at or above the threshold.  
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Save & Restart

    Finally, save the `divinemc.yml` file and restart your server. Sentry should now be integrated and ready to capture errors and logs based on your configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Troubleshooting Tips

- **Errors not appearing?**  
  - Confirm DSN is correct and in quotes.  
  - Ensure firewall allows outbound to <code>ingest.sentry.io:443</code>.  

- **Too much noise?**  
  - Raise <code>log-level</code> to <code>ERROR</code>.  
  - Ensure <code>only-log-thrown</code> remains <code>true</code>.

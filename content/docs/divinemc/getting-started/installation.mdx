### Running the Server

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Create a startup script for your operating system:

    ```bash tab="Windows" title="start.bat"
    java -Xms4096M -Xmx4096M --add-modules=jdk.incubator.vector -jar server.jar --nogui # [!code word:server.jar]
    ```

    ```bash tab="Linux/macOS" title="start.sh"
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    java -Xms4096M -Xmx4096M --add-modules=jdk.incubator.vector -jar server.jar --nogui # [!code word:server.jar]
    ```
    
    :::info
    
    For optimal performance, get customized JVM flags from [Birdflop Flags Generator](https://www.birdflop.com/resources/flags/) based on your server specs.
    
    :::
  </Step>

  <Step>
    The first launch creates an `eula.txt` file. Open it and change the following line:

    ```bash title="eula.txt"
    # By changing the setting below to TRUE, you agree to our EULA (https://aka.ms/MinecraftEULA).
    # Thu Jan 1 00:00:00 UTC 1970
    eula=false # [!code --]
    eula=true # [!code ++]
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Run the server again using the startup script you created. Once it fully loads, your installation is complete!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Now that you have your DivineMC server running, you can start [adding plugins](/docs/divinemc/getting-started/plugins) and configuring it to your liking.

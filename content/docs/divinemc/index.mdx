## Features
- **Based on [Purpur](https://github.com/PurpurMC/Purpur)** that adds a high customization level to the server.
- All worlds **are ticked in parallel**, so the server can take full advantage of multicore processors.
- **Implemented Secure Seed mod** that changes default 64-bit seed to a 1024-bit seed, making it almost impossible to crack the seed.
- **Optimized chunk generation** that can generate chunks up to 70% faster than vanilla.
- **Async** pathfinding, mob spawning and entity tracker
- Implemented **Linear region file format**
- **Fully compatible** with Bukkit, Spigot and Paper plugins
- **Fixes** some Minecraft bugs
- Integrated with [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) to easy track all errors coming from your server in excruciating detail (original by [Pufferfish](https://github.com/pufferfish-gg/Pufferfish))

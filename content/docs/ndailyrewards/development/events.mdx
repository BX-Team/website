NDailyRewards provides a range of events for you to use. This page will detail the events that NDailyRewards have.

Registered events that you can listen to:

- `AutoClaimEvent` - called when a player joins the server and the reward is automatically claimed.
- `PlayerClaimRewardEvent` - called when a player claims a reward.
- `PlayerReceiveReminderEvent` - called when a player receives a reminder about available rewards.

## Examples

### AutoClaimEvent

```java
@EventHandler
public void playerAutoClaimEvent(AutoClaimEvent event) {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    int day = event.getDay();

    player.sendMessage("You have claimed the reward for day " + day + " automatically!");
}
```

### PlayerClaimRewardEvent

```java
@EventHandler
public void playerClaimRewardEvent(PlayerClaimRewardEvent event) {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    int day = event.getDay();

    player.sendMessage("You have claimed the reward for day " + day + "!");
}
```

@EventHandler
public void playerRemindEvent(PlayerReceiveReminderEvent event) {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();

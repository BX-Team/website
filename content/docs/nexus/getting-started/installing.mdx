Nexus only supports Paper server and its forks from versions 1.19.4 to latest. Other server software, like Spigot, Bukkit, and others, are not supported.

You can download Nexus either from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/nexuss), or from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/BX-Team/Nexus/releases/latest).

Once you have downloaded the Nexus, put downloaded `.jar` file into the `plugins` folder of your server.

If you don't already have a permissions plugin, we recommend that you install LuckPerms to control permissions and access for commands for your players. This is optional but recommended.

After you have installed Nexus, you can start your server and Nexus will generate the default configuration file in the `plugins/Nexus` folder. You can edit the configuration file to your liking.

## Updating Nexus

To update Nexus, you can simply download the latest version of Nexus from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/BX-Team/Nexus/releases/latest) or from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/nexuss), and replace the old `.jar` file with the new one in the `plugins` folder of your server.

After you have replaced the `.jar` file, restart your server. Nexus should be automatically loaded by the server. Verify that the Nexus works properly and that all functionality is available after the update.

<CommandsTable />

### Configuring commands

You can change the aliases and cooldowns for any command in Nexus. To do this, you need to edit the `commands.yml` file in plugin folder. Here is the structure of the `commands.yml` file:

```yaml
commands:
  <command_name>:
    name: <command_name>
    aliases:
      - <new_command_aliases>
    permissions:
      - <new_command_permission>
    subCommands:
      <sub_command_name>:
        enabled: <true/false>
        name: <sub_command_name>
        aliases:
          - <new_sub_command_aliases>
        permissions:
          - <new_sub_command_permission>
    cooldown:
      enabled: <true/false>
      duration: <cooldown_duration> (e.g. 5s, 1m, 1h)
      bypassPermission: <cooldown_bypass_permission>
      message:
        chat: <cooldown_chat_message>
        actionBar: <cooldown_action_bar_message>
```

#### Example

Here is an example of how to change the aliases and cooldowns for the `/tpa` command:

```yaml
commands:
  randomteleport:
    name: randomteleport
    aliases:
      - rtp
      - randomtp
    permissions: []
    subCommands: {}
    cooldown:
      enabled: true
      duration: 1m
      bypassPermission: nexus.cooldown.bypass
      message:
        chat: "<dark_red>You must wait <white>{TIME}</white> before using this command again."
        actionbar: "<dark_red>Wait <white>{TIME}</white>!"
```

Messages support the `multification` library. You can view information about using it [here](/docs/nexus/getting-started/locale#notice-message-format).

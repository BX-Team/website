## Running Locally

To run the website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository. If you plan to make changes, create a fork first!

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/BX-Team/website
```

2. Install all required dependencies.

```bash
$ bun install
```

3. Start the development server.

```bash
$ bun dev
```

This will start a local development server and show you a link to the local website. The majority of changes will be instantly reflected live without the need to restart the development server or reload the page in your browser. Edit away!
